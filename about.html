<h2>Education and Training</h2>
<p>
Eva Ericsson completed her initial training in Sweden, where she earned her Graduate Degree in Social
work and Public Administration at the University of Gothenburg. Settling in the U.S., she devoted
herself to her clinical practice, and to learning new ways to understand and be helpful.
</p><p>
To that end, she completed the Advanced Clinical Training Program in Marital and Family Therapy at
The Family Institute (part of Northwestern University) and has recently completed the rigorous testing
for Certification from the Gottman Relationship Institute in Seattle, WA. Created by much-lauded
psychological researcher, John Gottman, this advanced approach is hailed as the first research-based
method of couples therapy, offering both insight and proven blueprints for change.

<h4>Philosophy</h4>
<p>
“Therapy allows me to exercise my natural inclination to help people in pain, using both compassion and
training. I am honored to share my experience, insights and support to help people better understand
the choices they make…and the choices they might make to bring meaningful change to their lives.“
